# opencl-go-driver

Introducing the Go OpenCL library, a powerful tool designed to bridge the gap between Go programming and OpenCL's parallel computing capabilities. This library simplifies the process of harnessing the power of GPUs and other accelerators, allowing developers to write high-performance applications in Go without delving into the complexities of OpenCL's C-based API.
